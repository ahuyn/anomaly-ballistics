| 9x19 JHP   		| HP   | I (0.055) | Jacketed hollow point, can defeat very basic armor but is better used for mutants |
| 9x19 JSP 	    	| Stun | I (0.099) | Soft Point rounds have limited expansion damage but can stun NPCs. Best for crowd control or lining up a headshot.|
| 9x19 7N21 AP    	| AP   | II (0.195) | Overpressure AP round with reduced damage and increased velocity. |
| 9x19 7N31 AP 		| AP   | III (0.225) | Enhanced overpressure AP round with increased magnitudes of the pros and cons of 7N21. |
| .45 ACP 		    | FMJ  | I (0.09) | Standard FMJ round.|
| .45 AP+P 	        | AP   | II (0.15) | Overpressure AP round. Not really realistic but gives .45 a viable anti-armor solution.|
| .45 HP 		    | HP   | I (0.069) | Hollow point. Slight damage bonus against mutants.|
| .45 LIFERIP       | Special HP | I (0.069) | Low damage, huge (200%) expansion multiplier. 10% of damage taken as health. |
| 7.62x25 P 		| FMJ  | IIA (0.14) | Standard FMJ round. Steel core penetrates light armor quite effectively. |
| 7.62x25 Pst 		| FMJ  | II (0.165) | Enhanced P round with better performance characteristics. |
| 7.62x25 HP 		| HP   | I (0.075) | Hollow point round. Narrow shape lets it preserve some anti armor capabilities. |
| 7.62x25 Acid 		| Special AP | IIA (0.149) | Deals acid damage. Each shot applies "acid" debuff to the NPC, reducing armor of that part by 40%. 50% more weapon impair. |

| 5.7x28 SS190 		| AP  | III (0.21) | Military AP round, effective against armor but hard to acquire. |
| 5.7x28 SS195 		| HP  | IIA (0.1) | Sporting hollow point variant of 5.7x28. |
| 5.7x28 CHAOS 		| Special | II (0.175) | Anomalous round with reduced baseline stats. Damage and AP fluctuates randomly. Shoot enough and is overall more effective than shooting normal bullets. |
| 12x70 Buck 		| Shot | none (0.025) | Standard buckshot. Buckshot ignores some armor when shooting limbs, simulating breaking a guy's legs with sheer force.|
| 12x70 Magnum 		| Shot | I (0.05) | Overpressure buckshot load. More damage, recoil, and impair. Capable of one shotting a boar. |
| 12x76 Slug 		| Slug | IIA (0.1) | Unitary projectile. Not sure what to do here - right now it just stuns enemies on bodyshot and ignores some armor on headshot. |
| 12x76 AP Dart     | Slug (AP) | II (0.175) | AP variant of slug with reduced baseline damage and massively increased armor defeating capability.|
| 12x70 Flechette 	| Shot (AP) | IIA (0.1) | Buckshot with enhanced armor defeating properties. Aim for the limbs! |

| 5.45x39 7N10 EP 	| FMJ+ | III (0.205) | 'Enhanced Penetration' FMJ round. Defeats higher armor class but suffers from overpenetration on softer targets. |

| 5.45x39 Soft Point| Stun | II (0.15) | Soft Point round that stuns enemies.  |
| 5.45x39 7N22 AP 	| AP   | IV (0.255) | AP smallbore round with reduced damage, more overpenetration malus and stronger anti armor capability. |
| 5.45x39 7N39 AP 	| AP   | V (0.305) | Magic slavic anti-armor rounds with even more magnified properties of AP rounds. |
| 5.56x45 FMJ 		| FMJ  | II (0.155) | Surplus FMJ rounds. Can fragment on penetration, randomly dealing increased damage. |
| 5.56x45 Mk318 	| FMJ+ | III (0.205) | Modern, enhanced FMJ rounds with slightly reduced fragmentary potential but better accuracy, velocity and AP. |
| 5.56x45 HP 		| HP   | IIA (0.105) | Hunting hollow point round. |
| 5.56x45 Varmageddon| Anti-mutant HP | IIA (0.125) | Specialized hunting hollow rounds that deal substantially more damage to mutants. |
| 5.56x45 M855 EP 	| AP- | III (0.225) | Reduced performance AP round. Penetrates armor, yes, but sacrifices a lot in stopping power to do so. Reasonably common. |
| 5.56x45 M855A1 AP | AP | IV (0.295) | M855 with its problems fixed. AP is improved, raw damage is improved and overpenetration is reduced. |
| 7.62x39 FMJ 		| FMJ | II (0.185) | Standard surplus FMJ round. |
| 7.62x39 M67 FMJ   | FMJ+| III (0.215) | Modern FMJ rounds produced by Yugoslavians. |
| 7.62x39 AP 		| AP | IV (0.275) | Armor penetrating rounds. |
| 7.62x39 API 		| AP Incendiary | IV (0.295) | Rounds that defeat armor and set people on fire. Awesome! |
| 9x39 SP-5 		| FMJ | III (0.245) | Subsonic FMJ sniping round.|
| 9x39 SPP   		| FMJ | IV (0.275) | Subsonic FMJ sniping round. Bonus damage and AP against unaware targets, making this very powerful if you can stay quiet.|
| 9x39 PAB-9 		| AP | V (0.33) | Surplus AP round. Technically better than SP-6 but destroys your gun really fast. |
| 9x39 SP-6 		| AP | V (0.325) | AP round. Slightly weaker than PAB-9 but safer to use.|
| 7.62x54 PP 		| FMJ | III (0.2) | 57-N-323S standard FMJ. Can be linked together to make an MG belt. Relatively low accuracy. |
| 7.62x54 7N1 		| FMJ (Sniper) | III (0.249) | Sniper variant with much better accuracy. |
| 7.62x54 HP 		| HP | II (0.155) | Sporting/hunting round. Full size rifle rounds still feature strong armor defeating capability for a rifle round.  |
| 7.62x54 Headhunter| Headshot | II (0.199) | Flat point precision round with extremely high accuracy. Ignores armor on (non-exo) headshots. Headshot kills cause ludicrous gibs. |
| 7.62x54 7N13 AP 	| AP | V (0.305) | AP round. Reduced accuracy. Full size rounds don't have as much of an overpenetration malus as smallbore rounds, so damage to very soft targets is still respectable. |
| 7.62x54 API 		| AP Incendiary | V (0.335) | AP round that also sets things on fire. |
| 7.62x54 PP MG 	| FMJ | III (0.2) | MG linked belt. Can be unlinked into individual rounds for rifles. |
| 7.62x54 Split Shot| Shot | IIA (0.125) | Reduced damage, increased spread, fires three projectiles. Projectiles inherit buckshot properties, meaning they deal extra limb damage and mutant damage. |
| 7.62x51 FMJ 		| FMJ | III (0.225) | Standard FMJ round. |
| 7.62x51 Mk316 Match| Type | IV (0.275) | Match quality FMJ round with much better accuracy. |
| 7.62x51 M61 AP 	| AP | V (0.335) | AP round. Effective against the strongest of threats. |
| 7.62x51 SLAP 		| AP+ | VI+ (0.395) | Saboted Light Armor Penetrator. AP round with magnified characteristics, and also can penetrate through multiple targets.|
| 7.92x57 FMJ 		| FMJ | II (0.195) | Standard FMJ round. |
| 7.92x57 Match 	| Sniper | III (0.215) | Match quality FMJ round. |
| 7.92x57 AP 		| AP | V (0.305) | AP rifle round. |
| 7.92x57 Lightning | Special AP | VI+ (0.399) | Dedicated anti armor round. Deals electric damage, scaling with target armor. Shooting sufficiently well armored targets causes an electric nova centered on the target. |
| .338 Lapua Magnum | AP | V (0.335) | AP sniper round. |
| .338 'Soulripper' | Overkill | VI+ (0.399) | Ludicrously overpowered sniper round. Penetrates anything and everything to the limits the engine will allow. |
| 12.7x55 	    	| FMJ | V (0.305) | Subsonic FMJ round. |
| 12.7x55 PT2 		| Sniper | V (0.335) | High accuracy variant designed for sniping.|
| 12.7x55 AP 		| AP | VI+ (0.375) | Subsonic AP round. |
| 12.7x55 EXP 		| Special | none (0.049) | Shots explode. Explosion is manually placed on crosshair; one consequence is this round is also perfectly accurate. |
| 4.6x30 AP 		| AP | II (0.175) | Unused |
| 4.6x30 FMJ 		| FMJ | IIA (0.135) |Unused |
| .50 Ball 		    | FMJ | V (0.335) |Unused |
| .50 AP     		| AP | VI+ (0.399) |Unused |
| 12x90 Bull 		| Slug (AP) | IV (0.25) |Unused |

## Miscellaneous usage/design notes
- The intent of this mod was more to have an excuse for fun bullet types over super realism ballistics. The basic formula I provided optimally behaves like vanilla but with the extreme outliers controlled.
- Within a given class, rounds are broadly subdivided into FMJ, HP and AP variants, depending on flavor.
- FMJ rounds are middle of the ground, providing a balance between stopping power and armor penetration.
- Hollow Points sacrifice a lot of armor penetration for very high stopping power, gaining huge bonus damage if the round fully penetrates. Due to how this penetration works, they will generally be more effective against heavily armored mutants.
- AP rounds have vastly increased armor penetration and velocity, usually at the cost of impair and damage. In order to defeat armor, rounds need pointed penetrators and need to be shot at higher velocities, which reduces stopping power as the rounds usually pass clean through. Full size rifle rounds are exempt as the sheer force of the round causes injury as it passes through.
- Old ammo has been transformed to be new ammo types. Generally the rule is for a given ammo, the 'old' variant is superior or fills a niche at the cost of rarity and impair. For example, 5.56 has a hollow point round (that is the 'normal' round) and the superior variant is 5.56 Varmageddon (which is specialized against mutants.)
## Ammo specific notes
- 9x18 and 9x19 rounds are designed to be the least offensive, boring as possible rounds. 9x18 should be quickly outmoded by 9x19 once it is available enough, but can still match up to somewhat dangerous threats.
- .45 ACP is tailored to be an anti-mutant class of rounds. LIFERIP will effectiely provide full heals on headshotting an unarmored head.
- 7.62x25 has surprisingly good armor piercing. Use it for heavier armor. However, it won't match against Berill-level plates.
- 5.45 rounds tend towards being more effective at armor. 5.56 does more overall damage and has specialized anti-mutant rounds.
- Buckshot is coded to deal extra damage to limbs and specifically to boars. Boars have very high armor relative to other mutants, which makes them quite tough with the damage system.
- Slugs are a little inconsistent and lack a good identity still. They are coded mostly as crowd control and budget sniping ammo.
- Most heavier rifle rounds (7.92, .338, 12.7x55) are all very samey outside of the artifact rounds.
- Fancier full size sniper rounds are a bit on the boring side, being sniping-optimized globally. This is subject to change.
