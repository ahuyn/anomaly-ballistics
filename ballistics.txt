0.011 = Nothing. Paper. Handgun bullets should be slowed down a little bit but it's nothing.
0.075 = Class I armor, single kevlar vest stuff. Should stop hollowpoint handgun rounds reliably

0.1   = Class II armor - basic stalker suit
0.125 = Combat suits, not body armor - advanced stalker suit, STS suits
0.15  = Heavier combat suits, PS5s

0.2   = Berill 
0.25  = no armors use this, ignore

0.3   = Only CS3 heavy
0.35  = SKAT-9 armor

0.4   = Duty PSZ armor, light exosuits
0.45  = Exoskeleton and Nosorog armor, AP short or full rifle rounds at minimum
0.47+ = ULTRA T H I C C only penetrable by fullsize rifle AP ammo (barely) and anti-material rounds. Only Duty and Military exos (standard?) have this

0.0-0.1 = no armor to basic
    - can be defeated by most pistol rounds, hollowpoints, etc
0.1-0.2 = kevlar armor to just below plate
    - pistol rounds start to struggle
0.2-0.3 = basic metal plate
    - smallbore rifle fmj, ap pistol
0.3-0.4 = advanced metal plate
    - largebore rifle fmj, smallbore ap
0.4+ = super strong armor, exosuit quality
    - o.4 is exosuit, 0.45 is exoskeleton/nosorog
    - largebore rifle ap

Basic formula

In order for a bullet to defeat an armor, the AP tier must match or exceed the bone armor tier.
Within the tier, compare the fractional parts and reduce based on the difference.
AP tier - bone tier is:
4: Overpenetrate, -60% damage
3: Overpenetrate, -30% damage
2: Ignore fractional, always full damage
1: Ignore fractional, always full damage
0: Modify by difference in fractional (no increase)
-1: 50% damage flat modifier
-2: 100% Impact damage only
-3: 10% Impact 
-4: 1% impact

For HP the impact damage for underperforming is increased, but it cannot overpenetrate.
