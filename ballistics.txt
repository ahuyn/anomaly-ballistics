0.011 = Nothing. Paper. Handgun bullets should be slowed down a little bit but it's nothing.
0.075 = Class I armor, single kevlar vest stuff. Should stop hollowpoint handgun rounds reliably

0.1   = Class II armor - basic stalker suit
0.125 = Combat suits, not body armor - advanced stalker suit, STS suits
0.15  = Heavier combat suits, PS5s

0.2   = Berill 
0.25  = no armors use this, ignore

0.3   = Only CS3 heavy
0.35  = SKAT-9 armor

0.4   = Duty PSZ armor, light exosuits
0.45  = Exoskeleton and Nosorog armor, AP short or full rifle rounds at minimum
0.47+ = ULTRA T H I C C only penetrable by fullsize rifle AP ammo (barely) and anti-material rounds. Only Duty and Military exos (standard?) have this

0.0-0.1 = no armor to basic
    - can be defeated by most pistol rounds, hollowpoints, etc
0.1-0.2 = kevlar armor to just below plate
    - pistol rounds start to struggle
0.2-0.3 = basic metal plate
    - smallbore rifle fmj, ap pistol
0.3-0.4 = advanced metal plate
    - largebore rifle fmj, smallbore ap
0.4+ = super strong armor, exosuit quality
    - o.4 is exosuit, 0.45 is exoskeleton/nosorog
    - largebore rifle ap

When it comes to AP:
- bullets have an AP roughly tiered the same as the armors
- bullets within the same tier or one above will reliably penetrate with consistent damage
- two or more above, you see overpenetration issues and damage is reduced
- one below, chance to defeat but damage is greatly reduced
- successive below exponentially reduces effectiveness


Basic formula

In order for a bullet to defeat an armor, the AP tier must match or exceed the bone armor tier.
