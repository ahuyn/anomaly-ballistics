		<text>A relatively new and restricted evelopment, these experimental rounds utilize a small amount of explosive material in the tip to, in theory, cause a directed explosion designed to defeat armor. Issues with the manufacturing process means that in practice, the whole round detonates on impact, acting as a sort of micro grenade. While extremely hazardous, certain eccentric stalkers will pay dearly for these rounds to hunt extremely large mutants.\n \n%c[d_purple] • %c[ui_gray_2] Highest pierced armour class: %c[ui_gray_1]IV\n%c[d_purple] • %c[ui_gray_2] Tissue damage rating: %c[ui_gray_1]very high</text>
