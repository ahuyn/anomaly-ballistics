# Recoil

This is a standalone module that affects enhanced recoil to take into account weapon recoil upgrades and ammo.

Standard enhanced recoil adds extra camera animations to simulate the force of recoil. This addon builds on top of that with subtle camera manipulation to give the effect of higher recoil.

MCM options allow to enable or disable these features as well as choosing to have stance affect recoil.

Recoil effects are also wildcarded to make importing easier.

Patch hooks available to modify recoil intensity.
