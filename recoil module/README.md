# Recoil

This is a standalone module that affects enhanced recoil to take into account weapon recoil upgrades and ammo.

Recoil effects are also wildcarded to make importing easier.

Main differences are:
- Emphasized initial shot recoil
- Consistent horizontal recoil

Patch hooks available to modify recoil intensity.
