# Recoil
This is a lightly modified version of base enhanced recoil to take into account weapon recoil upgrades and ammo.

Default configs are intended for arti_ballistics, but it is straightforward enough to implement your own.

The recoil effects are also wildcarded to make importing easier.

Aoldri has provided an improved version of enhanced recoil for testing. Main differences are:
- Emphasized initial shot recoil
- Consistent horizontal recoil

Due to laziness Aoldri's will supersede my original basic implementation after sufficient testing.
